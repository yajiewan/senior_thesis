; The Masuda paper displayed the following summary statistics:
; 1. Payoff of different strategies across generations
; 2. Mean degree of different strategies across generations
; 3. Fraction of each strategy within population across generations
; 4. Different update rules: Full imitation update vs. Fermi update rule
; 5. Different graphs: Scale-free vs. Regular random vs. Square lattice vs. Extended cycle

; Things I'm looking to explore apart from the above summary statistics:
; 1. The distribution of strategies within population weighted by number of neighbors(degree)
; 2. The average strategy within population with partial imitation learning
