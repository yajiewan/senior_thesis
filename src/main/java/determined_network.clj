;;; This file presents a minimal implementation, in Clojure, of the simulation described in:
;;; Riolo, Rick L., Cohen, Michael D., & Axelrod, Robert (2001), Evolution of cooperation without reciprocity,
;;; Nature 414: 441-43.
;;;
;;; By changing the `minimum-tolerance` parameter one can produce results similar to those described in:
;;; Roberts, G., & Sherratt, T. N. (2002). Does similarity breed cooperation? Nature, 418, 499â€“500.

;;; A world is a map containing a population (vector) of agents, along with counts of donations and failures.
;;; An agent is a tag, a  tolerance, and a score.
;;; New agents are initialized to random tags and tolerances, and scores of 0.
